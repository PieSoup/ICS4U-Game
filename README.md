# Box Benders

This is a 2D physics-based fighting game that combines the excitement of elemental manipulation seen in media such as Avatar: The Last Airbender with procedurally generated caves, offering a unique and endlessly replayable experience. Engage in battles with your chosen element-based class, navigate caverns, and unleash creative attacks to emerge victorious.

## Main Features:
### 1. Physics-Based Elemental Combat
The different kinds of elements combined with a system meant to mimic real-life physics allows for lots of emergent gameplay and creative strategies
### 2. Procedurally Generated Caves
Employ cellular automata to generate procedurally generated caves, ensuring each battle takes place in a unique environment. Enjoy infinite replayability as the game creates interesting cave structures.
